Recourses I used for starting go

As I started learning go right after finishing My "Fundamentals of Programming in C" course in AUT. It might be a good recommendation to be familiar with C when starting golang.

However I used websites listed below in my path of working with go:

-  https://tour.golang.org/ A very good start for introduction to what is go and what are it's capabilities
- https://gobyexample.com/ I think in the path of learning anything, learning by examples is an excellent way. This website lists frequently used go examples and is a good resource.
- https://github.com/golang/go/wiki Before go anywhere further, let me introduce this wiki page by go team. There is a complete list of almost "anything" in here about go. 
- https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Learn Everything listed here is included here beside many more resources.
- https://exlskills.com/learn-en/courses/aap-learn-go-golang--learn_golang_asap
- https://gophercises.com/ As an experience, most of us won't learn a new programming language except by using it. This website has 20 exercises for making you a go developer.

And it's not even started yet

Many thanks to
